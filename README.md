# Mental Health for Young Men and Men of Color JTC WOW Project
## By : Jeneil Stallion and Hernan Carvente-Martinez

As behavioral health advocates who work in the public health field, our passion is to raise awareness on behavioral health in our community. Historically and currently, men of color—-particularly African-American and Latinx, are overburdened by unaddressed mental and behavioral health disparities; often this stems from adverse childhood experiences and/or structural violence leading into adulthood. Within the field of behavioral health, Black and Brown men are under-represented in this profession. It can be an asset to have health professionals within the care network who have cultural context and lived experience addressing trauma as men of color, so we decided to show the disparity of resources targeted towards young men and men of color.

Our initial goal was to use python code to identify specific "actionable" mental health and wellness resources that we could share with young men and men of color in New York and Michigan. We aimed to accomplish this by web scraping some well known mental health websites and using python code to look through information on those website using specific keywords in the search bars. Unfortunately, we quickly realized two things: 
1. Not all websites had this information clearly and neatly organized in the HTML code and; 
2. Most of the resources that we were able to find were the typical sources that often times do not connect well with communities of color. This led us to quickly shifting our focus to seeing what was actually available in terms of resources on some of these well known websites.

Our project highlights the disparities of mental health resources specifically for young men and men of color. We chose to do research on NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), two of the top mental health organizations in the country. 

To accomplish this task, we used the following skills and resources:

* Python’s requests library
* Beautiful soup to parse and web scrape the data
* Created a For loop to iterate through specific ‘Keywords” and return search results
* Defined functions to pull specific information from html documents and return data
* Created a CSV file of parsed information from NAMI and NIMH websites
