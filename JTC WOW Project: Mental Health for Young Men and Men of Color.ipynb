    "As behavioral health advocates who work in the public health field, our passion is to raise awareness on behavioral health in our community. Historically and currently, men of color—-particularly African-American and Latinx, are overburdened by unaddressed mental and behavioral health disparities; often this stems from adverse childhood experiences and/or structural violence leading into adulthood. Within the field of behavioral health, Black and Brown men are under-represented in this profession. It can be an asset to have health professionals within the care network who have cultural context and lived experience addressing trauma as men of color, so we decided to show the disparity of resources targeted towards young men and men of color.
